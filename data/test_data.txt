🚀 Exciting advancements in medical AI! Introducing **MedVLM-R1**, a groundbreaking Vision-Language Model designed to enhance **transparency** and **trustworthiness** in medical image analysis.

🔍 **Why it matters**: Traditional VLMs often provide answers without revealing the reasoning behind them, which is essential for clinician trust and regulatory approval. MedVLM-R1 addresses this gap by utilizing a **reinforcement learning framework** that fosters human-interpretable reasoning paths.

📈 **Key achievements**:
- Increased accuracy from **55.11% to 78.22%** on MRI, CT, and X-ray benchmarks.
- Outperformed larger models trained on over **1 million samples**, despite being trained on just **600 visual question answering samples** with **2 billion parameters**.

🌟 With strong **domain generalization** capabilities, MedVLM-R1 is a significant step towards creating **trustworthy** and **interpretable AI** in clinical settings.
